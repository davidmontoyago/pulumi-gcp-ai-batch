Provide a summary of each comment and perform a sentiment analysis on each to identify frustration, impatience, and heated discussion and represent it as a number between 0 and 100, 0 being a cold status and 100 being a hot status: Customer: I am absolutely furious right now! I've been trying to resolve this billing issue for THREE WEEKS and nobody at your company seems to care or know what they're doing. I've been charged twice for the same service, my account is completely messed up, and every single person I talk to gives me different information. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life! Representative: I sincerely apologize for the frustration you've experienced, and I understand how upsetting this situation must be. Let me pull up your account right now and see what's been happening with your billing. Can you please provide me with your account number so I can review the charges you mentioned? Customer: Account number 4478-9921-3. And don't you dare put me on hold or transfer me to someone else! I've already explained this story four times to different people who clearly don't communicate with each other. Your company is a complete joke - I'm paying for services I'm not even receiving properly, and now you're stealing money from me with duplicate charges."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
