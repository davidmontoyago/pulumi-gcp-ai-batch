{"text": "The best dog food we have found. It has less and better ingredients than other foods. You have so many flavor options that you do not get with other foods. Our fur baby loves this food so we set up auto delivery!"}
{"text": "This is the ONLY product I can find on the dog-food market with true limited ingredients. Our pup is allergic to practically everything in normal or easy to find dog foods. Thankful we found this brand, which has worked amazingly well for him."}
{"text": "I never write reviews, but was so disappointed with this, I just have to. I was excited about this product due to the way it looks. For me though, this ended up a classic case of don’t judge a book by it’s cover. I actually just used it for the first time and hated it. It was hard to clean due to the fact that the opening isn’t big enough to get your hand through. I could NOT figure out how to fold the filter for the life of me (I looked for an instructional video, but couldn’t find one for the type I bought) and apparently I am not the only one who has this problem."}
{"text": "3 stars for deceptive description THIS DID NOT COME IN EXCLUSIVE PACKAGING"}
{"text": "I like the simple, clean, glass design. But it does not stay hot by the time you go to pour your second cup of coffee. Taste was really bitter until I added a pinch of salt to the grounds."}
